=======================================
BLOCKRECEIPT.AI POST-DEPLOYMENT UPDATE
=======================================

After deploying the Receipt1155 contract, follow these steps to update your application:

1. ENVIRONMENT VERIFICATION
   Current Contract Address: ${nftContractAddress}
   
   If this is your wallet address or not a valid contract address,
   update your .env file with the newly deployed contract address.

2. UPDATE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICE
   Replace the current blockchain service with the improved version that
   validates contract connections:

   > mv server/services/blockchainService-amoy.ts server/services/blockchainService-amoy.ts.bak
   > cp server/services/blockchainService-improved.ts server/services/blockchainService-amoy.ts

3. RESTART YOUR APPLICATION
   > npm run dev
   
4. VERIFY CONNECTION
   After restarting, check your application logs to confirm:
   - Successful connection to the Amoy network
   - Proper contract initialization
   - No errors in contract function calls

5. TEST NFT MINTING
   Try creating a new receipt to verify the NFT minting process works

IMPORTANT: The improved blockchain service includes the following enhancements:
 - Contract address validation (checks if it's a real contract, not a wallet)
 - Function availability verification
 - Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
 - Detailed logging for troubleshooting

Your application will now use a real smart contract for receipt management!

if (nftContractAddress !== minterAddress) {

NOTICE: It appears you may have already updated your environment variables,
as RECEIPT_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS and RECEIPT_MINTER_ADDRESS are different.
Continue with steps 2-5 to complete the update.
